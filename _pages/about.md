Hey!

Welcome to my tiny personal webpage/blog on some of the stuff I've learned 
throughout my degree.

I've always thought of writing about topics that I enjoy learning. 
But I've never found the time nor energy to do it until now.

Hopefully, I stick to this little project of mine, and over time, you'll 
see more and more posts about most things theoretical CS (and beyond).
