Hello there!

I am a lecturer at the [School of Computing, in the National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). Before this I was a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Divesh Aggarwal](https://sites.google.com/site/diveshhomepage/). Before this I did an undergraduate in computer science here in NUS as well. 

My research interests are mainly in structural computational complexity and I am currently working on varied topics in information theoretic cryptography. You may find 
my list of papers [here](/papers/). Most of my research interests in CS predominantly involved discrete mathematics.

I also like implementing cool ideas in C++, and exploring practical ideas around algorithms.

Most of my webpage is still under construction right now, so there really isn't much to see. Hopefully there more exciting posts to come eventually. :)
