Hello there!

I am a PhD student in [Divesh Aggarwal's group](https://sites.google.com/site/diveshhomepage/) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Centre for Quantum Technlogies (CQT). Before this I did an undergraduate in computer science here in NUS as well. 

My research interests are mainly in structural computational complexity and I am currently working on varied topics in information theoretic cryptography. You may find 
my list of papers [here](/papers/). Most of my research interests in CS have are predominantly influenced by 
discrete mathematics.

As of late, I've been spending my free time exploring C++ and practical ideas around algorithms, once in a while I may post about some things that I find interesting.

Most of my webpage is still under construction right now, so there really isn't much to see. Hopefully there more exciting posts to come eventually. :)
