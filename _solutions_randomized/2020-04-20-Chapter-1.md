## Introduction
### Question 1
#### Part (a)
{% katexmm %}

This is just looking for $Pr[X = 5]$ where $X \sim Bin(10, \frac{1}{2})$. Which is given as:
$$
\binom{10}{5} {\frac{1}{2}}^{5}
$$


{% endkatexmm %}


#### Part (b)

{% katexmm %}

The observation here is that we can associate each sequence of $10$ bits with its point-wise complement. And each sequence of $10$ bits occurs with equal probability. So, discounting the cases where there are equally many heads as there are tails, we just need half of the remaining cases. So that makes it:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \binom{10}{5} {\frac{1}{2}}^{5} \right)
$$
