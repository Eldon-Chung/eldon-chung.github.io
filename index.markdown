## Bio
I am a fresh graduate from the School of Computing (SoC) at NUS in Computer Science, with a focus in theory and algorithms. My research interests lie in theoretical computer science and I hope to one day work in structural complexity theory! Right now I would also love to work in other fields, such as pseudorandomness, randomised algorithms, or lower bounds in any area.

## Teaching Experience
Since my third semester, I have been a tutor and TA for a few modules in my school. In particular, I was a tutor for [CS1231 - Discrete Structures](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS1231/discrete-structures) and [CS2040/S - Data Structures and Algorithms](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2040S/data-structures-and-algorithms) for two and three semesters respectively. I was also a TA for [CS3230 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS3230/design-and-analysis-of-algorithms) for three semesters as well.

Oh yeah, and I've been put on the tutor honour roll at SoC for the academic year 19-20!

## Research Experience
I was lucky to do my UROP and dissertation with [Prof. Divesh Aggarwal](https://sites.google.com/site/diveshhomepage/), working on the hardness of lattice problems and data structure lower bounds respectively. Links to the reports will be up when I figure out how to host them.


## Hobbies
Besides teaching in my free time, I also love playing the guitar, and reading books. I might also code in my free time. Incidentally, I'm learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), it's been interesting so far.

I used to also shoot arrows. I had won 4 silver and 1 bronze medals during the 2016 NUS Indoors Archery Championship. I've since ended the hobby. Hoping to pick it back up when I have the time.
